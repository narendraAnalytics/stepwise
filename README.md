ABOUT THE PROJECT BASIC IDEA : 

StepWise - Project Description
One-Line Pitch
StepWise transforms math problems into learning opportunities by providing detailed, step-by-step solutions that teach concepts, not just answers.
Short Description (App Store)
Snap a photo of any math problem and get instant, detailed explanations for each step. StepWise doesn't just solve—it teaches. Perfect for students who want to understand math, parents helping with homework, and anyone learning at their own pace.
Detailed Description
What is StepWise?
StepWise is an AI-powered math tutor that uses advanced image recognition and Gemini AI to break down math problems into clear, understandable steps. Simply take a photo of any math equation—handwritten or typed—and receive a comprehensive walkthrough that explains not just the "how" but the "why" behind each step.
Key Features

Photo Recognition: Captures handwritten or printed math problems
Step-by-Step Solutions: Detailed breakdown of every calculation
Educational Focus: Explains concepts, not just answers
Multiple Methods: Shows different ways to solve the same problem
Practice Problems: Generates similar problems for reinforcement
Progress Tracking: Monitor learning improvement over time

Who It's For

Students (Grade 3-12): Understand homework, prepare for tests
Parents: Confidently help children without doing work for them
Adult Learners: Refresh math skills for career or education
Tutors: Quick resource for explaining concepts

Supported Math Topics

Basic Arithmetic
Pre-Algebra & Algebra
Geometry
Trigonometry
Pre-Calculus & Calculus
Statistics
Word Problems

Why StepWise?
Unlike other math apps that simply provide answers, StepWise is built on the principle that understanding beats memorization. Each solution includes explanations, common mistake warnings, and concept connections to build genuine mathematical understanding.
Technology
Powered by Google's Gemini AI model, StepWise combines cutting-edge OCR technology with advanced mathematical reasoning to deliver accurate, educational solutions in seconds.

Mission Statement
StepWise believes every student can understand math with the right guidance. We're building an AI tutor that's patient, clear, and always available—making quality math education accessible to everyone.

Learn math the right way. One step at a time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
